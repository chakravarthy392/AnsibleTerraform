## I. Basics 

1. Python Language Introduction :-

   In a Python script to print something on the console print() function is used – it simply prints out a line ( and also includes a newline unlike in C ). 
   
2. Python3 basics :-
   
   Python for its scope doesn’t depend on the braces ( { } ), instead it uses indentation for its scope.
   In other programming languages like C, C++ and Java, you will need to declare the type of variables but in Python you don’t need to do that.
```
   eg:-   mynum=4.5
          print(mynum)      

          o/p : 4.5
```
   Python have 4 types of built in Data Structures namely List, Dictionary, Tuple and Set.
```   
    # is used for single line comment in Python
    """ this is a comment """ is used for multi line comments
```

`input()` is used to get input from the console, need to specify the datatype if we need to perform operations on the read data.
Python used the keyword `def` to define a function.  ` eg:- def hello(): `

Python has a very rich module library that has several functions to do many tasks. 
`import` keyword is used to import a particular module into your python code.
